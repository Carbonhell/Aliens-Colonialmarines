			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Changelings now evolve powers via the cellular emporium, which they can access via an action button.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Due to budget cuts, the shuttle's hyperspace engines now create a visual distortion at their destination, a few seconds before arrival. Crewmembers are encouraged to use these "ripples" as an indication of where not to stand.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Shuttles now only run over mobs in turfs they are moving into, rather than the entire rectangle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you are an observer, you can click on transition edges of a Z-level in order to move as a mob would.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Due to safety concerns, the Hyperfractal Gigashuttle now has some safety grilles to prevent accidental matter energising.</li>

			<h3 class="author">coiax, incoming updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Due to budget cuts, the builtin anti-orbit engines on the station have been removed. As such, expect the station to start orbiting the system again, and encounter an unpredictable stellar environment.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">All permanent structures (not on station, Centcom or lavaland) have been removed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All removed structures are now space ruins, and can be placed randomly in space ruin zlevels.</li>
				<li class="wip">The White Ship remains at its current location, but has lost any reliable landmarks near it. Its starting position will be made more random in a coming update.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Space Bar has a small atmos system added and a teleporter. Some other ruins have been cleaned up to not have atmos active turfs.</li>
